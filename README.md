## When is lightable?

For now, I feel lightable as still quite pre-release software.

## Where is lightable?

Lightable is self-hosted, with the intention of having multiple hosts across multiple different people, and groups. It's made to be hosted by anyone!

## Why is lightable?

Being inspired by many Chat apps that have been created I wanted to take my own journey learning programming in the process

<h1 align="center">FAQ</h1>

> I want to run my own servers, how do I do that?

[Guide](https://github.com/brys0/Lightable/wiki/Selfhost)

> I have an issue or bug with my use of this software

Lightable has many bugs right now, It's hard to track and fix all of them being a solo dev. 
You can file an issue in the issues, or if you feel comfortable, you can try and make a pull request.

## Getting an invite 

Hey! Glad you're interested in trying out lightable while it's in its closed alpha stage

Here are some steps to receive an invite code:

* Sign up (for an invite) on the lightable desktop app
* Wait (If I don't respond in a week or-so I deeply apologize) 
* Receive a code through the email address you used. (You'll receive it directly from me!)
* Sign up again, set your name, email, password. 
* You'll see a modal asking for an invite code. Input your code, and have some fun!

## Becoming an administrator

Think you're cool enough to be an admin? Awesome! 
Here are the steps to be **that** cool 

1. Email me 
    - With your revelant information. Way to contact, name, etc.
    - Why you want to be an admin
    - How you would be a good fit
    - How you can help this project grow
    - Something about yourself, have some fun with it!
2. Wait
3. Don't be disappointed if I reject the request. No hard feelings. I will provide a reason, and the time until you can re-apply
4. If you get accepted, grats! Happy for you :)

### Guidelines

* Don't be stupid (Revoking people's, invite codes without a reason is VERY stupid)
* Don't be malcious (Don't troll, take it seriously)
* Don't leak peoples info. (Thats really scummy)
* Don't leak your own info 
* Don't use your "role" for solicitating something (if anything like this EVER happens, consider yourself removed from this platform for life)
* Be smart, if you have a question. ASK. before taking action (If someone is doing something dumb, use your best judgement. If it's another Admin, shoot me a message, and I'll be sure to take action when I can)
* Help others out. Administration is not limited to controlling, if someone has a question respectfully, and diligently respond

## Just because...

Just because lightable is completely open-source, doesn't mean (project server) is free from moderation. If you feel the absolute undying want to ruin others day. Do it alone on your own self-hosted server.
