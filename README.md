## When is lightable?

For now, I feel lightable as still quite pre-release software.

## Where is lightable?

Lightable is self-hosted, with the intention of having multiple hosts across multiple different people, and groups. It's made to be hosted by anyone!

## Why is lightable?

Being inspired by many Chat apps that have been created I wanted to take my own journey learning programming in the process

<h1 align="center">FAQ</h1>

> I want to run my own servers, how do I do that?

... 

> I have an issue or bug with my use of this software

Lightable has many bugs right now, It's hard to track and fix all of them being a solo dev. 
You can file an issue in the issues, or if you feel comfortable, you can try and make a pull request.
